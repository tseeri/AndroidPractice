    # Issue 69735:	Ddmlib is too agressive with timeouts in Device.java
    # ddmlib is timing out too quickly with the default 2 minute configuration when it doesn't receive input.
    # Considering Travis VM (and potentially the emulator) tends to run slow, we need to up this value
    # as installing an APK can take longer than 2 minutes.  (https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=69735)
